# Panacea

## Coder Factory Academy Term 2 Project: Two-sided marketplace app

### Problem
The purpose of this app is to improve patient access to community pharmacy services. When we or a loved one are sick, we often turn to the local pharmacy as the first port of call for primary care; however, it may not always be possible or practical to go to a pharmacy. 

### Solution
Panacea can be used for communicating with a pharmacist, from the comfort of one's own home. Using this app, pharmacies can register their business on the website. Members of the community can search for a local pharmacy and chat to an available pharmacist. 
Future releases could include video chat functionality and the ability to purchase products and medications recommended by the pharmacist directly through the app (not including prescription medications)
